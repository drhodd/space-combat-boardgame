## space-combat-boardgame

A prototype name for a prototype game.

### Setup (Windows)

1. Install MongoDB and NodeJS

2. Make sure your PATH variables are set

3. Point a CMD window to the repo directory

4. Run `npm install` to grab the Node dependencies.

5. Run `mongod` in one window and `npm start` in another.

### Setup (Linux)

Basically the same thing but the command to start the MongoDB server might be different.

`npm start` in the repo directory will launch the program, but make sure you run `npm install` first.

I'm not going to write specifics here because it's a bit more complicated than Windows.

### Setup (Mac)

¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
